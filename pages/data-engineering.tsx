      description: "Created a Snowflake data warehouse for an eBay seller. The client wanted both a CRM and a data warehouse to track their customers and their orders. They wanted to see the revenue generated by each customer and which were their best selling items.\n\nI used the eBay API to load data into the data warehouse and then used the data warehouse as a source for the CRM. The data warehouse served a dashboard which tracked the key metrics that the client wanted to see.\n\nI also built an ETL pipeline to allow the client to load Excel files into the data warehouse. Used dbt to help transform the data into the models used in the dashboard. Built the dashboard using React.",
