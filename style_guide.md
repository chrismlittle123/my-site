1. General Design Style
Typography:
Font: Use Sans-serif font (similar to Inter or Work Sans).
Font Weights: Use bold for headings, medium for subheadings, and regular for body text.
Color Scheme:
Gradient backgrounds: A mix of vibrant, saturated colors (e.g., pink, green, orange, purple) with smooth transitions.
Text color: White or light gray (#F3F4F6) for main text, slightly darker gray (#E5E7EB) for subtext.
Accent colors: Use subtle neon or gradient highlights for UI elements like buttons and icons.
Spacing:
Generous padding and margins for a clean, open layout.
Use consistent spacing for section headers and paragraphs.
2. Navigation Bar
Top Navigation Bar:
Background: Transparent or dark (#121212).
Logo: A simple, modern icon on the left with the name (like "Cursor").
Navigation Links: Aligned to the right, links styled as minimal text (white, all caps, small size, with hover animations like slight underlining or color change).
Buttons: CTA buttons (e.g., "Download") styled with a rounded border and white text.
3. Hero Section
Background:
Full-screen gradient background, smoothly blending vibrant hues (e.g., purple, pink, green, orange).
Main Heading:
Large, bold text with a clean, modern sans-serif font.
Center-aligned text, pure white for high contrast.
Subheading:
Smaller font size, slightly thinner weight.
Positioned under the main heading with a soft fade-in animation.
CTA Button:
Rectangular button with rounded corners, white border, and black text.
Hover effect: Border expands slightly, or a subtle shadow appears.
4. Feature Highlights (Grid Section)
Layout:
Three columns on desktop, stacked vertically on mobile.
Equal-width cards with slight rounded edges and a shadow.
Card Design:
Icons: Abstract 3D shapes or gradient visuals (e.g., cubes, triangles, glowing orbs).
Text: Bold headers for feature names, smaller subtext for descriptions.
Background: Black or dark gray, with subtle borders or glows around the edges.
Hover Effect: Slight zoom-in of the card or glow effect on the icon.
5. Secondary Section (Code Showcase)
Background:
Gradient similar to the hero but darker.
Content:
Code snippet displayed in a styled code editor (mimicking VS Code).
Syntax highlighting: Use colors similar to Prism.js themes.
Tabs (top of the code editor): Mimic file tabs in VS Code with subtle gradients and hover animations.
Animation:
Code lines should animate as if being written (e.g., using a typewriter effect).
6. Footer
Background:
Solid black or dark gray (#181818).
Content:
Left side: Minimal logo or tagline.
Right side: Links to social media and a small copyright notice.
Icons: Subtle neon-like hover effect (e.g., glow or color shift).
7. Animation Guidelines
Use Framer Motion or GSAP for smooth animations:
Fade-ins for text and elements when scrolling into view.
Hover effects for buttons and icons.
Smooth scroll animations for navigation links.
Parallax scrolling for the gradient background.
